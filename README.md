# vimrc

My `.vimrc` / `.vim`.

To use it just put the files into your `$HOME` directory on linux or rename to `_vimrc` / `vimfiles` and put into your installed vim direcory on windows.

The `.vimrc` itself is public domain, but third-party plugins inside the `.vim` have their own developers and licenses.
